# Changelog

## 1.0.0-alpha.1 (December 6, 2019)

First alpha release of dart_ftl -- the Fluent Project file parser.
At this point, the parser successfully parses all the test cases from
the original Project Fluent (https://projectfluent.org/) fixtures,
which are included in the testdata directory.

The AST included will most likely change based on actual uses of the
library, bug reports, and contributions. It should not be considered
stable at this point.
